## Overview

**MD Sketch** is a UI toolkit that builds upon the solid foundation of Bootstrap. Our goal is to provide a cleaner, more modern design system while retaining the power and familiarity of Bootstrap's grid and components. It's perfect for developers who love Bootstrap but are looking for a fresh, minimalist aesthetic for their projects.

This repository contains the official distributable files (`/dist` folder) for MD Sketch, ready for production use and CDN integration.

## Key Features

- **Modern & Clean Design:** A fresh take on common web components.
- **Built on Bootstrap:** Inherits the robust and proven features of the world's most popular CSS framework.
- **Lightweight:** Optimized for performance without sacrificing functionality.
- **Fully Responsive:** Mobile-first components that look great on any screen size.
- **Easy to Use:** Get started in seconds with multiple ways to install.
- **Copy & Paste Components:** A library of pre-built components. Just copy the code and paste it into your project.
- **Customizable:** Easily extend or override styles to fit your brand.

## Getting Started

Integrating MD Sketch into your project is simple. You can use our recommended CDN for the best performance or download the files to host them yourself.

### Option 1: Use the CDN (Recommended)

For the best performance and ease of use, we recommend linking to our files via the jsDelivr CDN. This ensures your users get the fastest possible load times.

Add the MD Sketch stylesheet to the `<head>` of your HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Awesome Project</title>
    
    <!-- MD Sketch CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="[https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/YourGitHubUsername/mdsketch@v1.0.0/dist/mdsketch.min.css](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/YourGitHubUsername/mdsketch@v1.0.0/dist/mdsketch.min.css)">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your amazing content goes here! -->
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Welcome to MD Sketch!</h1>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

**Important:** Replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username and `@v1.0.0` with the specific version number you want to use from your releases. Using a specific version number is highly recommended for production stability.

### Option 2: Download the Files

If you prefer to host the files yourself, you can download a `.zip` file containing all the compiled CSS from our latest release.

1.  Navigate to the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/mdsketch/releases).
2.  Under the latest release, click on `Source code (zip)` to download the project files.
3.  Extract the archive and locate the `dist/mdsketch.min.css` file.
4.  Copy that file into your project folder and link to it in your HTML like any local stylesheet.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/css/mdsketch.min.css">
```
